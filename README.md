# Fresh
Starting a fresh install of macOS and linux can be such a pain - all of your apps are gone and none of your settings are configured. Here's a collection of scripts, applications, CLI tools, extensions, config files, and dotfiles that make re-installing a breeze.

## Warning 
If you are interested in setting up dotfiles, you should fork this repository, review the code, and remove and edit any things you donâ€™t want or need. Use at your own risk!

## Start Here
Clone this repo to the hidden ~/.config directory in your home directory to restore your app's configuration files.

Run this:
```
git clone https://github.com/corb3t/fresh.git ~/.config
cd ~/.config
```

## Install Fonts
Navigate to /fresh/fonts and manually open all of the fonts in the folder. This will install them system-wide on your OS. MesloLGS NF provides really nice glyphs for your terminals:

## Install Brew
[Brew](https://brew.sh/) lets macOS and Linux users install applications from the command line. This lets users easily script and automate their app installation and configuration process using my fresh repo.

Enter the following in terminal:

``` 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" 
```

## Install Apps
To install off your apps outlined in setup-brew.sh, enter the following in terminal to run a script that will download as many app as possible using homebrew.

``` 
source ~/.config/setup-brew.sh
```

## Setup macOS Settings

``` 
source ~/.config/setup-macos.sh
```

## Setup symlinks

``` 
source ~/.config/setup-symlinks.sh
```

## Install Other Apps
Download my favorite apps from the App store or independent websites:

* [Tot](https://tot.rocks/) - Tiny Quick Note-taking app
* [Meeter](https://www.trymeeter.com/) - Show upcoming meetings in your menubar and easily launch the appropriate app
* [Gestimer](http://maddin.io/gestimer/) - Easily set a reminder from your menubar
